Connect Codegen to your GitHub repositories to enable agents to read code, create branches, commit changes, open pull requests, comment on issues, and more.

## Capabilities

Our GitHub integration grants Codegen agents both read and write access, allowing them to function like a member of your development team:

- **Read Access:** Clone repositories, read file contents, inspect branches, view issues and PRs.
- **Write Access:** Create branches, push commits, open/update pull requests, comment on PRs and issues, assign reviewers.

## How Agents Use GitHub

Agents leverage the GitHub integration to:

- **Understand Context:** Read code and related issues/PRs to grasp the task requirements.
- **Implement Changes:** Create branches and commit code directly based on your prompts.
- **Request Reviews:** Open pull requests and automatically request reviews from specified team members.
- **Report Progress:** Comment on related issues or PRs with updates, results, or requests for clarification.

## Installation
