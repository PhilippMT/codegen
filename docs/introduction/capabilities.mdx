Codegen agents come equipped with a versatile set of tools and capabilities designed to seamlessly integrate into your development workflow and automate a wide range of tasks.

## Integrated Tool Suites

Our agents have deep integrations with the tools your team already uses:

    Manage repositories, review PRs, comment on issues, create branches, commit
    code, and more.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Linear" icon="pencil" href="/integrations/linear">
    Update ticket statuses, add comments, link PRs, create new issues based on
    findings, and manage project boards.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Slack" icon="slack" href="/integrations/slack">
    Send notifications, ask for clarification, report progress, and interact
    directly with your team.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Core Features

Beyond specific tool integrations, Codegen agents possess fundamental capabilities:

  >
    Safely run code, install dependencies, and test changes in an isolated
    environment.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Web Search" icon="globe" href="/integrations/web-search">
    Access up-to-date information, research libraries, find documentation, and

<Note>
  These capabilities allow Codegen agents to handle complex tasks that require
  interacting with multiple systems, just like a human developer.
